# Type 
In this model a type is basically anything that can be stored in a database
Basic types cannot exactly be stored on their own as most databases support this
thus types here refer to actual objects that are translated to objects.


```php
<?php
class Apple{
       
}
```

A type has basic SQL properties it's dependence of other variables 
it's size limitations etc.

# Compound type is a type that extends a simple type
